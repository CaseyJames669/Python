#----------------------------------------------Assignment 6 Notes Due Friday----
#create list before initializing main()?
#may have to change the loop(delete the main() in if and elif, and insert a
    #loop after choice and before first if.
#can't be stuck in a loop, otherwise it will recreate itself...
#Ex. empList

#def addEmployee():
    #ask for name
    #add to empList (append)
    #create loop to see if they have more names to answer
    #use a while loop with user control(enter x to exit)
    #while tmpName != 'x': main()

#def printEmployeeList():
    #print company title
    #only print the title once using an if statement
    #if the list i empty, dont print title.
    #ex. if len(myList) == 0: DO NOT PRINT TITLE
    #len tells you how many items are in the list
    #using a for loop. 
"""
myList=[]
myList.append("Joe")
myList.append("Sally")
myList.append("Molly")
for ct in range(len(myList)):
    print(myList[ct])
"""
    #print some sort of error if no names are in the list...

#def sortEmployee():
    #.sort

#def deleteEmployee():
    #print names and then ask which one to delete
    #.remove
